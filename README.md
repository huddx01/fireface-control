# Fireface Control

A minimalist replacement for Totalmix on Linux, developped mostly for managing hardware monitoring and checking meters.

It is incomplete and unsupported, written quickly to get things working for me.

**Requirements**

- a Fireface 802 (firewire only)
- https://github.com/alsa-project/snd-firewire-ctl-services/
- https://github.com/jean-emmanuel/mentat
- https://github.com/jean-emmanuel/open-stage-control/


**Usage**

```
git clone https://github.com/jean-emmanuel/FirefaceControl
python FirefaceControl
```

**Notes**

Some settings (made with Totalmix, amixer or QasHCtl) may conflict.
